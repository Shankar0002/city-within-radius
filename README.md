City within Radius - Distance-Based City Finder
A tool that uses the Haversine formula to calculate and identify cities within a specified radius from a given location. Designed for applications in demand planning, logistics, and location-based analysis, this project automates the process of finding nearby cities based on geographical distance.

Features:

Calculates distances between cities using latitude and longitude.
Allows customizable radius input (in kilometers) to identify all cities within the specified range.
Useful for supply chain management, market analysis, and strategic planning.
Use Case: Built initially for optimizing fulfillment center locations, this tool enhances decision-making in e-commerce and logistics by providing data on proximity-based city options.

Tech Stack: Python, Haversine Formula, Pandas (for data handling), and optionally, Geopandas for mapping.
